  "faq.q0.question": "How does recoil strafing work?",
  "faq.q0.answer": "Recoil strafing is explained in detail in the guide by ahn99. In short, it works by combining recoil control with recoil smoothing via strafing and counter-aiming, which cancels out much of the horizontal recoil. This leaves you primarily responsible for controlling only the vertical recoil, making it much easier to consistently laser opponents at long distances.",
  "faq.q1.question": "Have feedback, found an error, or want to suggest a feature?",
  "faq.q1.answer": "You can share your feedback directly with RaVeN_ShP on Discord. If a weapon’s timing feels off, try adjusting it yourself using the Create Custom feature. Once you’ve fine-tuned it, include those details in your message so your feedback is as helpful as possible.",
  "faq.q2.question": "How does the Post-Reload delay work?",
  "faq.q2.answer": "Post-Reload delay is extra wait time after reloading before the next cycle starts. At 0s, there’s no extra wait — the countdown ends right as reload finishes. 0.5s gives you a small buffer to get ready. At 1.5s, the countdown starts when reload finishes. Choose what feels best.",
  "faq.q3.question": "How does the Reloading Phase work?",
  "faq.q3.answer": "The Reloading Phase is the part of the loop that covers the time your weapon reloads. Its length is: reload time (from empty) minus the 1.5s countdown, plus your Post-Reload delay.",
  "faq.q3.formula": "Length = reload time (from empty) − 1.5s countdown + your Post-Reload delay",
