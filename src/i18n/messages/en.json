  "faq.title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faq.q0.question": "How does recoil strafing work?",
  "faq.q0.answer": "Recoil strafing is explained in detail in the guide by ahn99. In short, it works by combining recoil control with recoil smoothing via strafing and counter-aiming, which cancels out much of the horizontal recoil. This leaves you primarily responsible for controlling only the vertical recoil, making it much easier to consistently laser opponents at long distances.",
  "faq.q1.question": "Have feedback, found an error, or want to suggest a feature?",
  "faq.q1.answer": "You can share your feedback directly with RaVeN_ShP on Discord. If a weapon’s timing feels off, try adjusting it yourself using the Create Custom feature. Once you’ve fine-tuned it, include those details in your message so your feedback is as helpful as possible.",
  "faq.q2.question": "How do Additional delays work?",
  "faq.q2.answer": "“Additional delay” is an optional buffer you can add to keep the rhythm comfortable. It exists in two places: - After Reload (Single Mode): extra wait after your reload finishes before the next cycle starts. 0s = no extra wait (the countdown ends as reload finishes). 0.5s adds a small buffer. At ~1.5s the countdown starts right when reload finishes. - After Swap (Dual mode): extra wait after swapping weapons. At 0s there’s no extra wait — the reload window is aligned so the stowed weapon finishes reloading at the end of the next pattern. Many weapon pairs already require ~1.5s, so often no extra delay is needed.",
  "faq.q4.question": "What are the phases and how do they work?",
  "faq.q4.answer": "Each loop cycles through: - Countdown: 1.5s of beats before the pattern starts. - Pattern: left/right/shoot steps. - Swap: (Dual mode) switches between Weapon A and B to set up Auto-Reload timing. - Reloading / Reload Buffer: covers the time your weapon reloads; in Auto-Reload, this is the window used as a buffer to ensure proper reload timing of the stowed weapon. - Delay: any additional delay that is calculated based on your value for the delay.",
  "faq.q6.question": "Why does the popout sometimes stutter or lag?",
  "faq.q6.answer": "This usually happens when Apex and the browser popout are both competing for GPU/CPU resources. Either run Apex in administrator mode or disable Hardware Acceleration in Chrome (Settings → System → 'Use hardware acceleration when available' → Relaunch).",
