  "faq.title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faq.q0.question": "How does recoil strafing work?",
  "faq.q0.answer": "Recoil strafing is explained in detail in the guide by ahn99. In short, it works by combining recoil control with recoil smoothing via strafing and counter-aiming, which cancels out much of the horizontal recoil. This leaves you primarily responsible for controlling only the vertical recoil, making it much easier to consistently laser opponents at long distances.",
  "faq.q1.question": "Have feedback, found an error, or want to suggest a feature?",
  "faq.q1.answer": "You can share your feedback directly with RaVeN_ShP on Discord. If a weapon’s timing feels off, try adjusting it yourself using the Create Custom feature. Once you’ve fine-tuned it, include those details in your message so your feedback is as helpful as possible.",
  "faq.q2.question": "How do Additional delays work?",
  "faq.q2.answer": "“Additional delay” is extra wait time you can add to keep the rhythm comfortable. It exists in two places: - (Single Mode): After your reload finishes, before the next cycle starts. 0s = no extra wait (the countdown ends as reload finishes). 0.5s adds a small buffer. At 1.5s the countdown starts right when reload finishes. - (Dual mode): After swapping weapons. At 0s there’s no extra wait. But some weapons empty their mag so quick, that we have to add a mandatory wait time, to let the gold mag reload (4s). These loops might not need an additional delay to feel comfortable to you.",
  "faq.q4.question": "What are the phases and how do they work?",
  "faq.q4.answer": "Each loop cycles through: - Countdown: 1.5s of beats before the pattern starts. - Strafe: shoot/left/right steps. - Swap: (Dual mode) switches between weapon A and B to set up auto-reload via gold mag. - Reloading / Reload Buffer: Covers the time your weapon reloads. In Dual Mode, this buffer ensures the stowed weapon has enough time to reload. - Delay: The extra wait time you set with the \"Additional Delay\" slider.",
  "faq.q6.question": "Why does the popout sometimes stutter or lag?",
  "faq.q6.answer": "This usually happens when Apex and the browser popout are both competing for GPU/CPU resources. Either run Apex in administrator mode or disable Hardware Acceleration in Chrome (Settings → System → 'Use hardware acceleration when available' → Relaunch).",
