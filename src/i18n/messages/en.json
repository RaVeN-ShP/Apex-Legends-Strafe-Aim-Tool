  "faq.q0.question": "How does strafe aiming work?",
  "faq.q0.answer": "Please refer to the guide made by ahn99.",
  "faq.q1.question": "Why is the popout not working?",
  "faq.q1.answer": "Only works on Chrome and Edge unfortunately.",
  "faq.q2.question": "How do I use the popout?",
  "faq.q2.answer": "Make sure Apex is running in borderless windowed mode. You can drag the popup slightly above your crosshair. This way you get both visual and audio cues.",
  "faq.q3.question": "The translation is incorrect? Who can I contact?",
  "faq.q3.answer": "RaVeN_ShP on Discord",
  "faq.q4.question": "Can you add X?",
  "faq.q4.answer": "Please request at RaVeN_ShP on Discord",
  "faq.q5.question": "The timing for X seems off. Can you fix it?",
  "faq.q5.answer": "If the timing doesn’t feel right, you can adjust it yourself using the Create Custom feature. Once you’ve fine-tuned it, please share it with RaVeN_ShP on Discord.",
  "faq.q6.question": "How does the Post-Reload delay work?",
  "faq.q6.answer": "Post-Reload delay is extra wait time after reloading before the next cycle starts. At 0s, there’s no extra wait — the countdown ends right as reload finishes. 0.5s gives you a small buffer to get ready. At 1.5s, the countdown starts when reload finishes. Choose what feels best.",
  "faq.q7.question": "How does the Reloading Phase work?",
  "faq.q7.answer": "The Reloading Phase is the part of the loop that covers the time your weapon reloads. Its length is: reload time (from empty) minus the 1.5s countdown, plus your Post-Reload delay.",
  "faq.q7.formula": "Length = reload time (from empty) − 1.5s countdown + your Post-Reload delay",
