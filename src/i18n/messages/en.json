  "faq.q0.question": "How does strafe aiming work?",
  "faq.q0.answer": "Please refer to the guide made by ahn99.",
  "faq.q1.question": "Why is the popout not working?",
  "faq.q1.answer": "Only works on Chrome and Edge unfortunately.",
  "faq.q2.question": "How do I use the popout?",
  "faq.q2.answer": "Make sure Apex is running in borderless windowed mode. You can drag the popup slightly above your crosshair. This way you get both visual and audio cues.",
  "faq.q3.question": "The translation is incorrect? Who can I contact?",
  "faq.q3.answer": "RaVeN_ShP on Discord",
  "faq.q4.question": "Can you add X?",
  "faq.q4.answer": "Please request at RaVeN_ShP on Discord",
  "faq.q5.question": "The timing for X seems off. Can you fix it?",
  "faq.q5.answer": "If the timing doesn’t feel right, you can adjust it yourself using the Create Custom feature. Once you’ve fine-tuned it, please share it with RaVeN_ShP on Discord.",
  "faq.q6.question": "What does Delay mean?",
  "faq.q6.answer": "For you the user it is pretty simple. At 0 seconds the countdown will start counting down during the reload and end exactly when the reload finishes. Since this leaves no room for error and gives you no time to prepare we suggest a wait time of 0.5sec.",
  "faq.q7.question": "What does End Phase mean?",
  "faq.q7.answer": "This is a time buffer we add so that the countdown will end exactly when your reload finishes. It is the result of the Reload (when empty) of the current Weapon (variable) minus the time of the countdown.",
